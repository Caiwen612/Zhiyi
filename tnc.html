            practitioner regarding the use of any goods, products or information
            received from the Sites before using or relying on them. Your physician or
            health care practitioner should address any and all medical questions,
            concerns and decisions regarding the possible treatment of any medical
            condition. Sephora does not give or intend to give any answers to medical
            related questions and these Sites do not replace any medical professional
            or medical resource. Sephora does not represent itself as a physician nor
            is this implied. No prescription medications or medical treatments are
            intentionally provided on the Sites.<b> If you are in need of medical
            attention, call emergency services or your physician immediately.</b>

        <p>
            3.6 While Sephora has tried to accurately display the colours of products,
            the actual colours you see will depend on your display monitor or screen
            and may not be accurately rendered.

            3.7 While we try to provide an accurate description of the products, we do
            not warrant that the descriptions, colours, information, pricing,
            promotions or other content available on the Sites is accurate, current or
            free from error. Sephora may correct any errors, inaccuracies or omissions
            and to change or update information or cancel orders if any information on
            the Sites is inaccurate at any time without prior notice, including after
            you have submitted your order.

        <p>
            4.1 The information set out in the Sephora Terms and the details on the Sites do not constitute an offer for sale, 
            but rather an invitation to treat. Your order constitutes your offer to us to purchase one or more items from us.
             No contract in respect of any products shall exist between Sephora and you until your order has been accepted by us, 
             evidenced by your receipt of a Shipping Confirmation e-mail from us. This is irrespective of whether or not funds have 
             been deducted from your account. Please note that if we do not accept your offer or are unable to proceed with the transaction
              and funds have already been deducted, they will be fully refunded via the payment method used by you.
        </p>

        <p>
        4.2 If you wish to place an order with us, you must follow the    <a href="faq.html">online purchasing procedure</a>. Once 
        you have added the products you wish to purchase to your bag through the Sites, click on “Secure Checkout” and provide the 
        necessary details (as indicated) to us to submit your order. Once you have done so, you will receive an email from Sephora
         notifying you of our receipt of your order (“<b>Order
            Confirmation</b>”). <b>Please note that this does not mean that your order has
            been accepted.</b>
        </p>
        
        
        <p><br></p>
        
        <p>
            4.3 All orders are subject to acceptance by us, and we will confirm such
            acceptance to you by sending you an e-mail that confirms that the item has
            been dispatched (“<b>Shipping Confirmation</b>”). The contract for the sale and
            purchase of an item between you and Sephora (“<b>Contract</b>”) will only be
            formed when we send you the Shipping Confirmation. The Contract will relate
            only to those items whose dispatch we have confirmed in the Shipping
            Confirmation. We will not be obliged to supply any other products which may
            have been part of your order until the dispatch of those items has been
            confirmed in a separate Shipping Confirmation. The Sephora Terms form a part of the Contract.

            discover an error in the price of any of the products that you have ordered, we will notify you as soon as possible 
            and give you the option of confirming your order at the correct price. If Sephora is unable to contact you, your order

            17.1 To the extent permitted by law, Sephora is providing the Sites, their
            Contents and the Interactive Services on an as-is basis and makes no
            representations, conditions or warranties of any kind, express or implied,
            with respect to the operation of the Sites or Interactive Services, the

        <p>
            17.3 To the extent permitted by law, Sephora will not be liable for any
            damages of any kind arising out of or in connection with the use of the
            Sites or the Interactive Services. This is a comprehensive limitation of
            liability that applies to all damages of any kind, including but not
            limited to direct, indirect, incidental, punitive or consequential damages,

            17.5 To the maximum extent permitted by law, and subject to applicable
            consumer protection provisions, Sephora is not liable for claims arising
            from your use of non-Sephora branded products. This will not limit any

        <p>
            17.6 Notwithstanding anything in the Sephora Terms, certain legislation, including the Malaysia Sale of Goods Act, may 
            impose consumer guarantees or imply warranties or conditions or impose obligations upon Sephora which cannot be excluded, 
            restricted or modified except to a limited extent. Such legislation may, for example, impose non-excludable guarantees that 
            goods are of acceptable quality or that services will be rendered with due care and skill (with certain remedies available to 
            consumers for certain breaches of such guarantees). To the extent that such legislation applies, the Sephora Terms must be read
             subject to these statutory provisions and nothing in the Sephora Terms is intended to alter or restrict the operation of such provisions.
