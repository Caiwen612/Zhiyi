    <h3>Beauty Pass Terms & Conditions (Malaysia)</h3>
    <div class="list">
        <ol>
            <li>Membership & Eligibility</li>
            <p>The Sephora Beauty Pass Program ("Program") is a rewards program offered by Beauty In Motion Sdn Bhd and Sephora Digital SEA Pte. Ltd. ("Sephora") to customers resident in Malaysia. Membership to the Program ("Membership") is limited to individuals only and is limited to one account per individual. Employees, officers, directors, agents and representatives of Sephora and its affiliates are eligible for Membership but may be excluded from certain promotions. You must be age 18 years or older and a legal resident of Malaysia to be eligible for Membership. Eligible minors must obtain their parent's or legal guardian's consent prior to participation. By submitting an application for Membership in the Program, you agree (or, if you are a minor, your parent or legal guardian agrees) to be bound by these terms and conditions ("Terms"). A purchase is necessary to become a member. Affiliates of Sephora may also have similar customer programs; Membership in the Program does not confer any rights or benefits in the program of any other Sephora affiliate.</p>
            <li>Earning and Redeeming Program Rewards</li>
            <p>Under the Program, you earn one (1) Beauty Pass point (“point”) at the rate specified on the Program website when you purchase merchandise (excluding the purchase of e-gift cards, gift cards and shipping costs) in Sephora stores and online (Australia, Malaysia, Singapore, Thailand) and online (Indonesia, Hong Kong SAR, New Zealand, Philippines). You must provide a form of identification at the point of purchase to have any points credited to your Beauty Pass Account. The form of identification may consist of your Sephora Beauty Pass e-mail address, phone number, membership number or full name. Points may be redeemed for rewards ("Rewards") subject to these Terms and further details set out on http://www.sephora.my/beauty_pass (the “Program Website”). Details of the Rewards available and how to redeem these Rewards are on the Program Website , including any limits or conditions on redeeming Rewards.
                Subject to the termination provision of these Terms, points expire after 18 months of inactivity. Points may be redeemed for Rewards to be determined by Sephora in its sole discretion; provided, however, that in order to redeem your points for any Reward, you must (i) accumulate a minimum number of points as established by Sephora, and (ii) make an additional purchase of merchandise from Sephora at the time that you redeem your points. Program members are able to redeem no more than one of each Reward per transaction. Program members cannot redeem more than 5 of any one unique Reward per year. Points have no cash value and can only be redeemed for Rewards. Sephora may, in its discretion, allow points to be redeemable for other items of merchandise from time to time. However, points are never redeemable for cash.
                Rewards are available with point redemption while supplies last and substitutions by Sephora may occur. If your online order is not completed during the same visit, the Rewards will be removed from your shopping basket and may no longer be available. You are not required to redeem a Reward during checkout. Due to the limited nature of the Rewards, we regret that we are unable to reship Rewards if they arrive damaged, if you received the wrong one or if one is missing from your order. In the event a Reward arrives damaged, you received the wrong one, or one is missing from your order, please contact Sephora customer service or visit your local Sephora store. Otherwise, Rewards may not be returned or exchanged. If a Reward becomes unavailable for reasons beyond Sephora's control, Sephora may substitute a Reward of equal or greater value. Rewards are shipped with merchandise purchases ONLY. The retail value of the Reward does not count toward Sephora’s free shipping threshold.
                </p>
